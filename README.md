# Theming-KDE
There are two ways to do this:
1. Using built-in KDE store for your Themes (for this i suggest using Kubuntu or Manjaro KDE)
2. Using the KDE Store (use any distro of your choice)

# 1. Using the built-in store:
just click on the "Get New" button and install your desired theme and That's it!
